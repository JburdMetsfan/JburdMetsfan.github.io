# Description:
This page serves as the home base to my MIT | xPRO Project Portfolio.  I will be attaching projects as I work through my coding bootcamp.  This page also includes information about me and the best way to get in touch.

# How to Run:
Download all files to your local machine.  Drop the HomePage.html file on to a blank web page.  This page has code copied from Bootstrap to assist with the layout.  The home page will provide all the required navigation throughout the different pages and projects.

# Future Roadmap
Additional Features I would like to add to this page:
  - Continuous improvements to existing projects as I learn more throughout the bootcamp
  - New Exercise that we work on in the upcoming modules
  - Updated spacing/design on the ProjectPage
